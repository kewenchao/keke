This libary provides mixins and views to handle signup, login and logout
in an API built with django-rest-framework.  After login, client
applications get a token for the API requests.

Email-based signups and Facebook login are supported.

Contrary to other similar modules, rest-auth-toolkit doess not provide
a set of Django apps to include and configure in your settings, but a
collection of mixins, base classes, base views and simple templates
that you can integrate and customize in your own apps.
